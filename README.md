## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### Useful resources

- [Octokit core.js](https://github.com/octokit/core.js#readme) - It is a tool that allowed me to use the Github API without the need to make CLI calls
- [Get a user endpoint in the Github API REST](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/users/users?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-user) - The documentation can be very overwhelming the first time, this is the exact endpoint to get a github user

## Acknowledgments

I recommend that you use your github token from the first moment of using the Github REST API since the API has a greater capacity to be used without restrictions
